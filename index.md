Hi, I'm Xintao Xie, an undergraduate student from South China Agricultural University majoring in Electronic Information Science and Technology. During my time at SCAU, I became a member of the AIE Lab, a research laboratory under the Technology Department of the SCAU Science and Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Federation.

In the laboratory, I actively participated in research projects related to the Internet and embedded systems. My interests lie deeply in industrial robotics, electronic control, algorithms, and autonomous navigation. I am enthusiastic about exploring and contributing to advancements in these fields.
